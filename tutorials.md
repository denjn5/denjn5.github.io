Welcome! This site is part blog, part tutorial. Mostly tutorials. I've organized them below for simpler access.

Each tutorial in a series builds on the previous one. I strive to explain every line, and each concept. If I don't explain it, it may be covered in a previous tutorial (or you can let me know).

Each titled section begins with a short introduction, a code block, and then the detailed explanation. Most of this series is also on [bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/denjn5):

I hope that these posts will help you extend your skills, solve a problem in your own code, or build something that you're proud of. I welcome your ideas.

Do good!
