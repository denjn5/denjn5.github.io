Welcome! d3 visuals look great. But they can be challenging to build. And I spend more time than I want to admit finding a bl.ocks.org that's close to what I want, then messing with it until it does what I want. And I'm still not sure why it does what it does.

So this site is dedicated to sharing d3 visuals that are _simple_, _d.r.y._, and _well-documented_.

Each tutorial builds on previous ones. I strive to explain every line, and each concept. Skip through the sections that you don't need. Let me know if I don't explain something, or explain it well.

I hope that these posts will help you extend your skills, solve a problem in your own code, or build something that you're proud of. I welcome your ideas.

Do good!
