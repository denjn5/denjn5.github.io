Welcome! My site is part blog, part tutorial. Mostly tutorial. You'll see a full list below.

<blockquote>“Begin at the beginning,” the King said, very gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.” <br>
<cite>–Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland</cite></blockquote>

Each tutorial in a series builds on the previous one. I've been challenged by tutorials that skip the concepts that I need to understand. So, instead, I strive to explain every line, and each concept. I trust you to skip through the parts you don't need. Let me know if I don't explain something, or explain it well.

I hope that these posts will help you extend your skills, solve a problem in your own code, or build something that you're proud of. I welcome your ideas.

Do good!
