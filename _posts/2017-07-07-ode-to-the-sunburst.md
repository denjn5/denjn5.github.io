title: Ode to the Sunburst

I am fond, maybe too fond, of the d3 sunburst. Its clean lines, obvious symmetry, and smooth tweens make me smile.

Sunbursts deserve more respect than we give. Do they look too much like their older, oft-disparaged cousin, the pie-chart? Is creating them too complex? Is their hidden, hierarchical data structure not well understood? I cannot change the world's perspective, but I hope to change yours....

When paired with meaningful labels and simple colors, sunbursts convey clear, intuitive messages. They communicate both relative size, and layers of context. When properly animated, changes flow like the clear waters of a glacier mountain stream.
 
Over the next few posts, I hope to make you a true believer in the sunburst; and make it a part of your visualization repertoire. 

Do good!
