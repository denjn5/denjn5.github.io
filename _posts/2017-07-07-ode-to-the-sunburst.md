title: Ode to the Sunburst
---

Sunbursts deserve so much more respect than we give them. Do they look too much like their older, oft-disparaged cousin, the pie-chart? Is creating them too complex? Is their hidden, hierarchical data structure not well understood? I cannot change the world's perspective, but I hope to change yours....

When paired with meaningful labels and simple colors, sunbursts convey clear, intuitive messages. They communicate both relative size, and layers of relationship (context?). When properly animated, changes flow like the clear waters of a glacier mountain stream.
 
Over the next few posts, I hope to make the sunburst a part of your visualization repertoire. 

Do good!  _â€”David Richards_
