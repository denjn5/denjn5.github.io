![viz]({{ page.png_url }}){:style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 300px;"}  In this tutorial we'll start with our labelled sunburst (Tutorial 3) and make some important improvements: better font and several label formatting additions (wrap, avoid leaking over edges, and "no select") to our Tutorial 2 sunburst.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we move from a plain sunburst, to one that has labels. (Tips: Keep the raw code open in a separate tab. Do a code compare between tutorial 1 and 2.)

### Just the Code
The tl;dr version of this tutorial:

## Format with CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Style) is a powerful set of formatting and animation features. Most web pages have a `<style>` section towards the top used to set formatting. We've actually already been using CSS, maybe without realizing it: anytime we call the `.style()` method in d3, it's CSS.

Imagine we have an svg circle that we'd like to size and color: `<circle class='circles' id='myCircle'></circle>`.  We'd typically link a block of CSS key:value pairs to our page in 1 of 3 ways, easier shown than described:
1. 

When to  we use a `<style>` block

### Google Font
This section is optional; it updates the font for our sunburst.

``` css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway');

body {
  font-family: "Raleway", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

We'll use `<style>` blocks for CSS a lot in the future. So it's helpful if you get used to them now. Plus, I'm not a fan of the default font for our sunburst labels. Let's add a style block to our html to gussy it up. I've
* `@import` gets the Raleway font from [Google](https://fonts.google.com/).
* `font-family` tells our page to use Raleway first, but provide alternatives if it's not available.

### Make Labels 'Non-Selectable'
In Tutorial 3, the label text was selectable.  That'll get annoying as we get users to interact with our viz. We've added a line to our CSS to avoid that.

``` css
text { pointer-events: none; }  /* Make text 'non selectable' */
```

The new style directive `text { pointer-events: none; }` tells our page that whatever is in the `<text>` element is not selectable with the mouse-pointer


### Format the Path
Common styling is often handled in a `<style>` block at the top of our code. That lightens up our JavaScipt / d3 and makes consistent styling between our visualizations easier to manage.

``` css
path { 
    stroke: #fff; 
    stroke-width: 1px;
}
```

We can use the style section to replace any fixed formatting that we've placed in `.style()` commands (unless it's programmatically driven).

These lines style any `<path>` elements in our code (unless they are overwritten by higher-priority styling). The path is the line between our slices. We color the path white (#fff).  This should replace the `.style('stroke', '#fff')` that was in our `slice.append('path')` block. We also set the width of the stroke to 1px.
