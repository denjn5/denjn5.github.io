DAVID'S SCRATCH
TODO: {NEW HIERARCHIES} Add MECE comments, decision tree
FEATURE: {COOL VIZ} Add cool hierarchical d3 vizs from around the web?
FIXME: {EXAMPLES} Make them pop on!
FEATURE: {STRATIFY} Address stratify really well.
FIXME: {COLUMNS} Use .right-column instead of tables

CONSIDER: {RANDOM} Randomly growing viz?

Hey Ian,
Here's an updated outline. Each bullet is a presentation page (usually).
* It's shorter. Still too long?  If so, thoughts on what I should cut?
* PostIts idea is great. Let's use 4 colors: root/red; 2nd-level/blue; 3rd-level/yellow. That'll help solidify the single root and help folks see the transition from hierarchical JSON to tabular and back (I hope).
* I've started building the presentation:


Outline:
* Introduction [10 minutes; pic: complex tree]
    * What's our Goal? [engineering pic]
    * How do we Illustrating Hierarchies? [several pages: zip through of coffee, tree of life, etc.; end with simple chart examples, no labels]
    * What is a Hierarchy? [definition: what makes a hierarchical dataset?]
    * Hello World [show simple dataset in json; call-out (don't explain) javascript arrays and objects]
    * Natural Hierarchies?
* Let's make our own viz [20 minutes; pic: PostIt's]
    * Let's create a PostIt note hierarchy together [my example; use colors]
    * What's the JSON look like? [show]
    * And our chart? [tree, sunburst, pack; with labels]
    * Can you show me the simplest possible code example? [~55-line tree; mention layout, root, nodes/links]
* But our data doesn't look like that. [20 minutes, pic: row of palm trees]
    * Let's lay our PostIts out like our data. [rebuild in tabular format; show, short explanation of the 'hidden' hierarchy and importance of unique names]
    * And our chart? ['same' charts (using new data behind the scenes; tree, sunburst, pack; with labels]
    * How does this change our code? [d3.stratify; show multi-root error]
    * Adding data is now super easy. [show new data in csv (my lessons); and our updated chart]
* Cool extras [5 minutes]
    * Can we show this as a Force chart? Yes! [.links()]
    * [time permitting] Which are the key docs? [d3.hierarchy]
    * [time permitting] Slide on d3.linkHorizontal() [way better than writing manaul path / line]

My example hierarchy:
* my cars
    * owned
        * bmw
        * pilot
        * honda
    * traded
        * chevette
    * lessons learned
        * odyssey
        * maxima

IAN'S INPUT
I generally agree with the format/content youve outlined here. One initial reaction is that there isnt enough time to give people everything here, so I want to think out loud about some possibilities.

The first section "why" my be less important than we think, many people will already be motivated to get better with hierarchical data, and those who are just curious could be motivated by the hands on aspects. perhaps a quick intro with interesting visual examples could do the job?

I really like the examples you give in this section tho, what if we use those as prompts for people to create their own datasets? most people could think of a set of cities thats relevant to them, or their family tree, or a favorite book. By getting them to create their dataset they will be very familiar with it. we could maybe use postits to let them create the "nodes" and they could draw the links  on the paper they stick it to.
if they can't think of one we should have a couple simple&universal examples handy to give them.
this could also be in place of the legos, im having a hard time coming up with a concrete example using them. id still like to if you can!

with the post-its we could have them move between "tabular" and tree representations physically (moving into section 2 now)
we could also have them transcribe their postits into json. both into a tabular form as well as directly into a hierarchical form depending on how you want to introduce them to stratify/d3.hierarchy in section 3.

once they have their data it should be quick to swap between a few visuals like you suggested. however i still think it will take longer than we think.

HIERARCHICAL	                        TABULAR
Relationships are intrinsic	            Relationships formed at run-time
smaller data	                        larger data
one-to-many relationships	            many-to-many relationships
gateway to sunbursts, trees,
    treemaps, circle packs

# Hierarchical data = JSON Arrays + JSON Objects

## JSON Array
`[ "Listen", "Learn", "Grow" ]`
    1. an ordered list of values, seperated by commas
    2. it can store strings, numbers, booleans, objects, other arrays, or a combination
    3. surrounded by [ and ] (square brackets)
<br>&nbsp;<br>

## JSON Object
`{ "name": "John", "age": 30, "motto": [ "Listen", "Learn", "Grow" ] }`
    1. a list of key/value pairs
        * each pair is seperated a comma
        * keys and values are separated by a colon
    2. each key is a string; each value is a strings, numbers, booleans, objects, other arrays
    3. surrounded by { and } (curly braces)
