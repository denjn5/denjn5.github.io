# David's Blog
My [blog](https://denjn5.github.io/) contains d3 and python tutorials. Specifically, we'll walk line-by-line through code to make sense of it.
  
Wanna skip the blog? You can review the d3 visuals directly in the d3 directory. But all of the good stuff is located in the _posts directory.


This is a Jekyll blog, built on github's framework with markdown and html.
